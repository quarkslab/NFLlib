# NFLlib
NTT-based Fast Lattice library

Work in Progress ... the library should be available in a few weeks.

## Goal

NFLlib is an efficient and open-source C++ library dedicated to ideal lattice cryptography. It is specialized in polynomial rings quotiented by a cyclotomic polynomial whose degree is a power of two. The library combines algorithmic optimizations (Chinese Remainder Theorem, optimized Number Theoretic Transform) together with programming optimization techniques (SSE and AVX2 specializations, C++ expression templates, etc.).

## License

When published here the library will be available under an open source license.
